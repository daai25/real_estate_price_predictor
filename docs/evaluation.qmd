# Evaluation Protocol

This protocol documents the decisions taken at the evaluation stage of the **Real Estate Price Predictor** project. The evaluation was conducted in a team workshop on **2025-07-24**, with the aim of assessing whether the results of the data mining phase meet user needs and whether to proceed to deployment.

## Participants

## Evaluation Summary

### Do Results Meet User Needs?

**Yes.**  
The developed Random Forest models achieved high predictive performance, surpassing the minimum success criteria outlined in the Project Charta (R² > 0.75, MAE < 300 CHF). The models provide accurate, interpretable predictions for both rental and purchase markets and are ready for integration into a dashboard for user interaction.

### Continuation of the Project

**Yes.**  
The team unanimously decided to proceed with deployment and further development. The results were deemed robust and aligned with the project goals.

### Planning of the Deployment

Deployment will include:
- Integrating the trained Random Forest models into a web-based user interface.
- Backend implementation of the prediction API.
- Monitoring and maintenance plan for the deployed models.
- Documentation of model assumptions and limitations for transparency.

Planned timeline: see Project Gantt Chart — Phase 4: Visualization (2025-07-24 through 2025-07-28).

### Additional Data Mining Iteration

**Not required at this stage.**
However, the following future enhancements were noted:
- Augment data with external sources such as demographic and transport data.
- Improve clustering methods by incorporating domain-specific ontologies.
- Reassess governance and ethics as data privacy regulations evolve.

## Envisioned Product

The final product to be deployed is a **web-based prediction dashboard** that:
- Allows users to input property features and obtain real-time price predictions.
- Visualizes prediction confidence and key feature contributions.
- Offers insights into market segmentation (via clusters) and trends.

## Notes

The team acknowledges the limitations identified in the modelling phase, particularly:
- Market dynamics not yet accounted for.
- Dependence on scraped data quality and completeness.

These points will be addressed in future project iterations.
